# SOAP-Service-and-Client-Handlers
A fairy generic SOAP Service and Client with a handlers used for the authentication process (on both sides). 

Avoided using a database to keep it simple. Used a thread safe Map and a textfile (inventions.db) instead. 

Not a solution for production, but a good way to get an understanding of how SOAP handlers work on both service and client side.
